#Linux Setup

To install the necessary files, you must first of all have git installed.

```
sudo apt-get install git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/quoder/dotfiles.git

```

Make sure that `setup.sh` has required permissions to execute and your language is UTF-8 enabled. Now,

`./setup.sh`

and relax :D
